			<p>A few TRAA members cleared a number of fallen trees and other blockages on October 13th.

				Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view.

				If you have further questions about TRAA stream habitat projects and events, please come out to the TRAA General Meeting on Wednesday, November 14th or contact us.

				<p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.

				They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it. This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank side damage and erosion.
				We were also fairly certain that this was a barrier to migratory and resident fish passage.</p>

				<h2 class="Event3">Work Party - Hatchery Roof Repair Saturday, June 30, 2018</h2>

				<div id="Image1">

				<p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd.

				Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.

				At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side.
				It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!

				The resulting damage, shown in this picture after the tree was removed, will required the replacement of these metal roof panels and the plywood sheathing underneath them. In addition, a couple of the roof trusses needed to be repaired.

				It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time. 
				There were materials left over for the tool shed roof as well but that will be another day!

				If you have questions about this event or would like to get involved with other hatchery projects, please contact us.</p>
